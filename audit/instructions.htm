  <table><tr><td> <strong> Auditing Process on voting day</strong> 
<ol> 
<li>Each precinct being covered will have a team outside ready to get a parallel vote from voters as they exit voting area. 

<li>Each team will have at all times a designated supervisor who will keep track of auditors administering the parallel vote. This supervisor 
	   is given a strong password to open the application.  The supervisor reveals this password to no one else.  

<li>Supervisor activities
	 <ul>
    <li>Supervisor will set up his/her own device at the center point of the auditing region.  
      The bounds of the auditing region should be reasonably small (150 yard radius or less).  Auditor devices will not operate if they are too far away from 
      the auditing region. 
    <li>Supervisor will regiser his/her own device at the center point, and click on the Set-Reset Center link.  
    <li>Supervisor will register the device of each Citizen Auditor by logging into auditor's device as supervisor, 
    	registering the device
    	   ( without centering ) and logging out.  Supervisor then returns the device to the auditor.  Supervisor is 
    	   careful to not let the auditor know the supervisor login credentials. 
    	 
    </ul>    
<li>Auditor activites
	 <ul>
    <li>There will be at least two auditor active at any time.. The supervisor can be an auditor if aboslutely necessary. 
    <li>Auditors will Intake voters as they leave the official voting area.  The voter will be given the auditors device opened to the Intake page. 
    <li>Auditors will attempt to get every single voter. 
    <li>After Intake, the auditor will pass the voter onto a second auditor to get the parallel vote. 
    	   The audit vote records are completely private and the auditor indicates no interest in the voters vote. 
    <li>If a voter was denied the vote for any reason, 
      the auditor will provide his device to the voter opened to the Non-voter page (no Intake is done)
    </ul>
<li>Shutdown. 
	  <ul>
   <li> If an auditor leaves for the day, the supervisor will shutdown the auditor's device from the supervisor menu. 
   <li>If an auditor demonstrates improper behavior, the supervisor can shutdown the auditor at any time. 
   <li>At the end of the voting day, the auditor will shutdown all auditor devices. 
   </ul>
</ol>
